This repository was developed as part of a University project on Complex Systems. The primary objective is to investigate and model the price propagation logic across fuel stations in Lombardy, Italy.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) were consulted to refine the documentation and conceptual explanations, the core logic and code were developed independently. I found that AI-generated code solutions often introduced unnecessary complexity that didn't align with the project's goals. 

I acknowledge that the current codebase contains redundancies and could be further optimized following software engineering best practices; however, the focus of this work remains on the analytical framework and the empirical findings regarding market dynamics.
